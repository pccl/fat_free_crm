The Issues plugin for Fat Free CRM is designed to work in sync with
a regular bug tracking application (such as Lighthouse, trac or
Bugzilla). It allows you to create an issue, which is tied to an
account and may refer to a bug ticket from your external bug
tracking application. When the ticket for a bug is closed, you can
search for issues which correspond to that bug, and mark the bug as
resolved. These issues are then queued for admin staff to contact
each account, after which the issue itself can be marked as resolved.
 
Once the plugin is installed run the following command:
 
rake db:migrate:plugin NAME=crm_issues
